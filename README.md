# Clone_BatChu
This is a clone version of game "bắt chữ", a popular game with several million downloads at 2014. Because it was suspended on my app store so I will share it to everyone as a reference.
This game has new playing rule:
 - the image was separated by 4 equal parts
 - firstly top-left part will turn
 - then each other part will turn after 15s
 - the points reward increase base on time, little time high points.
 - you can skip to force display each part by click on button

*New playing rule:*
