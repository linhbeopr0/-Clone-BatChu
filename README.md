# Clone_BatChu

This is a clone version of game "bắt chữ", a popular game with several million of downloads at 2014. Because it was suspended on my app store so I will share it to everyone as a reference.

**This game has new playing rules:**
 - the image was separated by 4 equal parts
 - firstly top-left part will flip
 - then each other part will flip after 15s
 - the points reward increase base on time, little time high points.
 - you can skip to force display each part by click on button
 - hint 


**New playing rule:**
